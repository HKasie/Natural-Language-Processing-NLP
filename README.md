# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP
Analyzing a collection of text documents (newsgroups posts) on twenty different topics.

## Purpose Of Project

To load the file contents and the categories, then extract feature vectors suitable for machine learning. Train a linear model to perform categorization using a grid search strategy to find a good configuration of both the feature extraction components and the classifier.

## Explanation Of Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.
